## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm run server
3. $ npm start
4. Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of react, express, mongoDB, and recharts. My personal project is to create an expense tracker that will show your expenses by line item / category in pie chart format and table format.
